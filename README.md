Analytical Modeling of HgCdTe Homojunction Photodetector for LWIR Free Space Optical Communication
Internship Summary
This project involved the analytical modeling of a p+-Hg0.78Cd0.22Te/n-Hg0.78Cd0.22Te/CdZnTe homojunction infrared photodetector. The goal was to enhance the understanding of key performance metrics for long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) and very long-wavelength infrared (VLWIR) photodetectors, primarily for free-space optical communication systems.
